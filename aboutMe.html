    <p>
        I am a recent graduate who graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Washington State University. From my research experience and numerous team projects, I have learned valuable professional skills. These include working in a team-based environment, improving my communication skills, leadership skills, and organization skills. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven critical thinking, problem-solving, and creative thinking skills. Throughout college, I was accountable for my work, remaining organized to ensure I met all the deadlines. I relied on my time management skills and stayed calm when under pressure. Ultimately, it paid off. I completed my bachelor's degree and graduated with honors. The entire process showed me the benefits of hard work and dedication with the rewards that followed.
